                  Water-based drilling fluids are formulated using water as the continuous phase. These fluids are environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and versatile, suitable for a wide range of drilling applications. They provide good hole stability, excellent fluid loss control, and can be easily adjusted for specific drilling conditions.
